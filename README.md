# SimpleLineaRegression
You are given a real estate dataset.  Real estate is one of those examples that every regression course goes through as it is extremely easy to understand and there is a (almost always) certain causal relationship to be found.  The data is located in the file: 'real_estate_price_size.csv'.  You are expected to create a simple linear regression (similar to the one in the lecture), using the new data.  In this exercise, the dependent variable is 'price', while the independent variables is 'size'.
